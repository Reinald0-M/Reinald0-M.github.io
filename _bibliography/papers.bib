  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly referred to as 3D printing, has undergone significant advancements, particularly in the realm of stimuli-responsive 3D printable and programmable materials. This progress has led to the emergence of 4D printing, a fabrication technique that integrates AM capabilities with intelligent materials, introducing dynamic functionality as the fourth dimension. Among the stimuli-responsive materials, shape memory polymers have gained prominence, notably for their crucial applications in stress-absorbing components. However, the exact 3D shape morphing of 4D printed products is affected by both the 3D printing conditions as well as the stimuli activation. Hence it has been hard to precisely control the 3D shape morphing accuracy. To model and optimize the dynamic 3D evolution of the 4D printed parts, we conducted both simulation studies and real-world experiments and introduced a novel machine-learning approach extending the concept of normalizing flows. This method not only enables the process optimization of the dynamic 3D profile evolution by optimizing the process conditions during 3D printing and stimuli activation but also provides interpretability for the intermediate shape morphing process. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the nuanced interplay between process parameters and the dynamic 3D transformation process in 4D printing.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the way we design, prototype, and produce complex parts with unprecedented geometries. However, the lack of understanding of the functional properties of 3D-printed parts has hindered their adoption in critical applications where reliability and durability are paramount. This paper proposes a novel approach to the functional qualification of 3D-printed parts via physical and digital twins. Physical twins are parts that are printed under the same process conditions as the functional parts and undergo a wide range of (destructive) tests to determine their mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. Digital twins are virtual replicas of the physical twins that are generated using finite element analysis (FEA) simulations based on the 3D shape of the part of interest. We propose a novel approach to transfer learning, specifically designed for the fusion of diverse, unstructured 3D shape data and process inputs from multiple sources. The proposed approach has demonstrated remarkable results in predicting the functional properties of 3D-printed lattice structures. From an engineering standpoint, this paper introduces a comprehensive and innovative methodology for the functional qualification of 3D-printed parts. By combining the strengths of physical and digital twins with transfer learning, our approach opens up possibilities for the widespread adoption of 3D printing in safety-critical applications. Methodologically, this work presents a significant advancement in transfer learning techniques, specifically addressing the challenges of multi-source (e.g., digital and physical twins) and multi-input (e.g., 3D shapes and process variables) transfer learning.}

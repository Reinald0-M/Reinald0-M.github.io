This was my biomedical engineering senior design project in Spring 2024 at Georgia Tech. This projected allowed us to expore the entrepreneurial side of engineering, working very closely with doctors from Emory University Hospital. We performed countless user interviews, designed 100+ prototypes, and built the final product from scratch. I was able to work with 3 other great friends and teammates on this exciting project!

The Butterfly is an innovative vital sign monitoring device that measures five essential health parameters using a single compact system: heart rate (HR), body temperature, oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (RR), and 3-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The device is designed with two elastic bands crossing the chest in an "X" configuration. One band integrates a piezoresistive wire for respiratory rate monitoring. The ends of each band attach to electrodes placed on the patient for 3-lead ECG recording. A body temperature sensor is positioned at the center of the bands, while an SpO2 sensor extends from the center and clips onto the earlobe. All sensors are powered by an Arduino system enclosed in a sleek central unit adhered to the abdomen.

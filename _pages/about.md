Hey, y'all!

I am a Machine Learning PhD student at [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at the <b>Georgia</b> Institute of <b>Tech</b>nology! My advisor is [Professor Jing Li](https://sites.gatech.edu/jing-li/). I have a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech as well. 

[Here](assets/pdf/Reinaldo_Mock_Resume.pdf) you can find my CV! Please feel free to reach out with any questions. 

I am currently interested in multimodal data analysis and sensor system optimization applied to biomedical systems. I am entrepreneurially motivated, and hope to apply my work to the creation of a novel biomedical device to better the lives of others. 

Outside of the lab, I enjoy going to the gym, cooking, and playing the piano and guitar!
